no distinction between insert and replace in KISSS

Hash table size is a space/speed trade-off parameter.
 Larger hash tables will reduce collisions and speed things up a bit, at the expense of memory and disk space.
  A good size is usually about 1/2 the average number of entries you expect.


  Features:
  Very space-efficient (on disk) if small hash tables are used

  Limitations:
  No indexes
  Add/update only, no delete
